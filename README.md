# SBB Lost & Found

Real-time lost item recovery for Swiss public transport. Connects passengers with train staff while the item is still on board.

## The Problem

1.2 million items lost annually in Swiss public transport. Current recovery rate: ~25%. The bottleneck is time -- by the time a passenger contacts the Fundburo, the train has moved on and the item is buried in a depot somewhere.

**Key insight**: items reported within 30 minutes have a >70% recovery rate. Items reported after 24 hours: ~25%. The entire architecture is built around collapsing that time gap.

## How It Works

| Step | Action | Time |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Passenger reports loss in-app | < 1 min |
| 2 | Staff receives real-time push notification | < 30 sec |
| 3 | Staff searches at next opportunity | During trip |
| 4 | Passenger gets status update | < 30 min |

Two interfaces: passenger app (`/`) and staff app (`/staff`). Open both side by side to see the real-time flow.

## Architecture

### Microservice Design

```
Frontend (Next.js 14, port 3005)
    │
    ├── Reporting Service (Express, port 3001) ── PostgreSQL
    │        │
    │        └── Redis pub/sub ── events ──> Notification Service (port 3003)
    │                                              │
    │                                              └── Socket.io ──> Staff browser
    ├── Matching Service (port 3002) [stub]
    └── API Gateway [stub]
```

Four services. Reporting is fully implemented. Matching and Notification are stubbed with defined interfaces -- the architecture is in place, the AI matching algorithm is next.

### SSOT Discipline

Every category of data lives in exactly one file:

| File | What It Owns |
|------|-------------|
| `lib/types.ts` | All TypeScript types and enums |
| `lib/config.ts` | Timing windows, validation limits, API URLs |
| `lib/labels.ts` | All German UI text (i18n-ready) |
| `lib/schemas.ts` | Zod validation schemas (derived from types) |
| `lib/design-system.ts` | Colors, spacing, typography for non-CSS contexts |
| `lib/tenant.ts` | **Operator identity — wordmark, product name, locale, code** |

Adding a new item category requires changes to 2 locations in `types.ts` -- `ITEM_CATEGORIES` enum and `ITEM_CATEGORY_CONFIG`. Forms, labels, validation, and display all auto-update.

### White-label: the operator is configuration

The app carries no operator's identity in its code. Branding is expressed in
exactly two places, and switching operator is one environment variable:

```bash
pnpm run build                          # Nordbahn — the neutral house brand
NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT=sbb pnpm run build   # SBB livery, same binary
```

| Where | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `frontend/lib/tenant.ts` | Wordmark, legal name, product name, locale, operator code, theme colour |
| `frontend/app/globals.css` | Palette + font, in one `:root[data-tenant="…"]` block per operator |

`<html data-tenant>` is set once in `app/layout.tsx`, and every colour token
keys off it — so the palette flips at runtime from a single attribute. Adding
an operator is two edits: a `TENANTS` entry and one CSS override block
restating only the tokens that actually differ.

**`pnpm run check:tenant` enforces this** (and runs inside `pnpm run verify`):
it fails the build if an operator name appears anywhere outside those two
files. The codebase previously spread one operator's name across 600+
references, and nothing would have failed if that crept back — the app would
have quietly stopped being re-brandable.

#### Trademark safety

A tenant marked `isConcept: true` uses a third-party trademark, so it is a
pitch artefact and not a product. Those builds automatically:

- render an "unabhängiges Konzept — kein offizielles Produkt" notice on every
  screen, and
- emit `robots: noindex, nofollow`.

The neutral tenant is the **default**, including when `NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT` is
unset or misspelled: failing open to someone else's brand is the one failure
mode that carries real cost. Only a tenant with `isConcept: false` may be
deployed to a public URL.

### Real-Time Event Flow

```
Passenger submits report
    → Reporting Service persists to PostgreSQL
    → Publishes to Redis channel: "lost_item_created"
    → Notification Service receives event
    → Broadcasts via Socket.io
    → Staff browser receives via useWebSocket() hook
    → Notification card appears in real-time
```

WebSocket connection has auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s -- max 30s, max 5 attempts).

### Graceful Degradation

`useApiWithFallback()` hook -- tries the real backend, silently serves mock data from `lib/mock-data.ts` if unavailable. The shop directory keeps working. No error pages for infrastructure failures.

### Lost Item State Machine

```
reported → searching → found → returned
                    → not_found → closed
```

Three time windows drive priority:
- **Instant alert** (< 30 min): driver notification immediately
- **Priority** (< 2 hours): fast-track processing
- **Standard** (< 24 hours): regular queue

### SBB Design System

Official SBB corporate identity -- not approximated, implemented from their design specs (applied as the `sbb` tenant). SBB Red (#EB0000) reserved for primary actions only. 4px spacing grid. Typography scale from 12-32px. All tokenized as CSS custom properties in `app/globals.css`, exposed as `brand` / `app-*` Tailwind classes (mirrored in `design-system.ts` for non-CSS contexts).
