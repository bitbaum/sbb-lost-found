/**
 * Where the backend lives, for THIS build.
 *
 * There is deliberately no localhost fallback. A production build ships these
 * values inlined into the browser bundle, so a `|| 'http://localhost:3001'`
 * default does not mean "try the dev backend" — it means every visitor's
 * browser aims the request at port 3001 of *their own machine*. That is what
 * sbb.orangecat.ch shipped until this change: doomed requests, and a real
 * chance of hitting whatever unrelated app a developer happens to run there.
 *
 * Unset therefore means exactly what it says: no backend is reachable from this
 * build. Local development gets its values from `.env.development`, which Next
 * loads in dev only, so the defaults can never leak into a deployed bundle.
