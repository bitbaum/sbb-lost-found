# The app is white-label: an operator's identity is expressed in exactly two
# places — frontend/lib/tenant.ts (strings) and the :root[data-tenant=...]
# blocks in frontend/app/globals.css (colours/fonts). Everything else must be
# operator-agnostic.
#
# This exists because the codebase was originally written for one operator and
# the name was spread across 600+ references. Re-introducing one hardcoded name
# silently un-does the white-labelling — nothing would fail, the app would just
# quietly stop being re-brandable. So the rule is enforced, not documented.
